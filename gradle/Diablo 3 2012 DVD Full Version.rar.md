## The Classes and Their Roles
 
Diablo 3 offers seven different classes to choose from, each with its own unique style, skills, and abilities. You can play as a Barbarian, a Crusader, a Demon Hunter, a Monk, a Necromancer, a Witch Doctor, or a Wizard. Each class has four primary attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Vitality. Depending on your class, one of these attributes will increase your damage output, while Vitality will increase your health.
 
Each class also has six active skills and four passive skills that you can unlock and equip as you level up. You can also modify your skills with runes that change their effects or add new ones. You can switch your skills and runes anytime outside of combat, allowing you to experiment and adapt to different situations.
 
Each class also has a resource that fuels their skills. For example, Barbarians use Fury, Crusaders use Wrath, Demon Hunters use Hatred and Discipline, Monks use Spirit, Necromancers use Essence, Witch Doctors use Mana, and Wizards use Arcane Power. Each resource has its own mechanics and regeneration rate, adding another layer of strategy and diversity to the gameplay.
 
Each class also has a role that defines their strengths and weaknesses in combat. For example, Barbarians and Crusaders are melee fighters that can deal high damage and take a lot of hits. Demon Hunters and Wizards are ranged attackers that can deal massive damage from afar but are vulnerable up close. Monks and Necromancers are hybrid fighters that can switch between melee and ranged attacks depending on the situation. Witch Doctors are summoners that can control hordes of minions and cast curses on their enemies.
 
Each class also has a theme and a backstory that reflects their personality and motivation. For example, Barbarians are savage warriors that hail from the snowy lands of Mount Arreat. Crusaders are holy knights that follow the teachings of Zakarum. Demon Hunters are vengeful hunters that have lost their families to the demons. Monks are spiritual warriors that seek balance and harmony. Necromancers are masters of life and death that manipulate the forces of nature. Witch Doctors are tribal shamans that commune with spirits and ancestors. Wizards are rebellious mages that defy the laws of magic.
 
Each class offers a different experience and challenge in Diablo 3. You can try them all and find the one that suits your playstyle and preference.
