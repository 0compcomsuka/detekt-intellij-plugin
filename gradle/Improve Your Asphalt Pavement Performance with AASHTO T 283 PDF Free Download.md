# How to Download AASHTO T 283 PDF for Free
 
AASHTO T 283 is a standard method of test for resistance of compacted asphalt mixtures to moisture-induced damage. It is used to determine if the materials may be subject to stripping and also to measure the effectiveness of additives. The test is performed by compacting specimens to an air void level of six to eight percent and then subjecting them to water saturation and accelerated water conditioning. The change of diametral tensile strength resulting from the effects of water is measured and reported as a ratio.

## What is Moisture-Induced Damage in Asphalt Mixtures?
 
Moisture-induced damage in asphalt mixtures is a phenomenon that occurs when water infiltrates into the pavement and weakens the bond between the asphalt binder and the aggregate particles. This can lead to loss of strength, stiffness, and durability of the pavement, as well as cracking, rutting, and potholing. Moisture-induced damage can be caused by various factors, such as poor drainage, inadequate compaction, low-quality materials, freeze-thaw cycles, and traffic loading.
 
## Why is AASHTO T 283 Important?
 
AASHTO T 283 is important because it provides a standardized and reliable method to evaluate the susceptibility of asphalt mixtures to moisture-induced damage. By using this method, engineers and contractors can select the appropriate materials and additives for their pavement projects and ensure their long-term performance and serviceability. AASHTO T 283 can also help to identify and prevent potential problems and failures in existing pavements and to design and implement effective maintenance and rehabilitation strategies.

1. Prepare six specimens of asphalt mixture with a target air void level of six to eight percent.
2. Measure the initial diametral tensile strength of three specimens using a loading device and a strain gauge.
3. Condition the remaining three specimens in a vacuum chamber for one hour and then immerse them in a water bath at 60Â°C for 24 hours.
4. Measure the final diametral tensile strength of the conditioned specimens using the same loading device and strain gauge.
5. Calculate the tensile strength ratio (TSR) for each specimen by dividing the final strength by the initial strength.
6. Report the average TSR for the three specimens and compare it with the minimum TSR specified by AASHTO or other agencies.
