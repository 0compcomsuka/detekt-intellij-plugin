Water and wastewater technology is a field of engineering that deals with the design, operation, and maintenance of systems for water supply, treatment, distribution, and disposal. It is essential for public health, environmental protection, and economic development. One of the most comprehensive and authoritative books on this topic is **Water and Wastewater Technology** by Mark J. Hammer, a professor emeritus of civil engineering and a consultant in environmental engineering.
 
This book provides a clear and concise introduction to the fundamental principles and current practices in water and wastewater engineering and technology. It covers all major aspects of water processing, water distribution, wastewater collection, wastewater treatment, sludge processing, and water reuse. It also includes relevant topics from chemistry, biology, hydraulics, and hydrology that are necessary for understanding the concepts and applications of water and wastewater technology.

- Chapter 1: Introduction to Water Supply and Wastewater Management
- Chapter 2: Chemistry for Environmental Engineering
- Chapter 3: Biology for Environmental Engineering
- Chapter 4: Hydraulics for Environmental Engineering
- Chapter 5: Hydrology for Environmental Engineering
- Chapter 6: Water Processing
- Chapter 7: Water Distribution
- Chapter 8: Wastewater Collection
- Chapter 9: Wastewater Treatment
- Chapter 10: Sludge Processing
- Chapter 11: Water Reuse

The book is well-written, well-illustrated, and well-referenced. It uses numerous examples, diagrams, tables, charts, graphs, and photos to explain the concepts and methods of water and wastewater technology. It also provides many homework problems, sample calculations, and case studies to reinforce the learning outcomes and to apply the theory to practice. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in environmental engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, and related disciplines. It is also a valuable reference for professionals and practitioners in water and wastewater engineering and technology.
 
The book is available in both print and digital formats. The latest edition is the seventh edition published by Pearson in 2016. The previous editions were published by Prentice Hall (2001-2012) and Wiley (1986-1996). The book has been widely used as a textbook for courses in water and wastewater technology in many universities around the world.
