Articleship is an important part of the Chartered Accountancy course, where students gain practical experience and skills under the guidance of a qualified CA. After completing the full period of articleship, which is usually three years, students are required to submit Form 108 to ICAI as a proof of their training.
 
Form 108 is a certificate issued by the principal (the CA under whom the articleship is done) that contains details such as the name of the student, the name of the principal, the registration number, the period of articleship, the work areas covered, the stipend received, and any other relevant information. The form has to be signed by both the student and the principal.
