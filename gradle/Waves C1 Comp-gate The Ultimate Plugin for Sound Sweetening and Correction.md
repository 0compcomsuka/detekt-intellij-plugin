## How to Use Waves C1 Comp-gate Plugin
 
To use Waves C1 Comp-gate plugin, you need to load it on a track or a bus in your DAW. The plugin has four main sections: Compressor, Gate, Sidechain, and Output. Here is a brief overview of each section and how to adjust its parameters:
 
### Compressor
 
The compressor section allows you to control the dynamic range of the signal by reducing the level of loud sounds and boosting the level of quiet sounds. You can adjust the following parameters:

- Threshold: The level above which the signal is compressed.
- Ratio: The amount of compression applied to the signal above the threshold.
- Attack: The speed at which the compressor reacts to the signal.
- Release: The speed at which the compressor returns to its normal level after the signal drops below the threshold.
- Knee: The shape of the curve that determines how smoothly or abruptly the compression starts and ends.
- Makeup: The amount of gain added to the output of the compressor to compensate for the level reduction.

### Gate
 
The gate section allows you to control the noise floor of the signal by reducing or muting the level of quiet sounds below a certain threshold. You can adjust the following parameters:

- Threshold: The level below which the signal is gated.
- Range: The amount of attenuation applied to the signal below the threshold.
- Attack: The speed at which the gate opens when the signal exceeds the threshold.
- Release: The speed at which the gate closes when the signal drops below the threshold.
- Hysteresis: The difference between the opening and closing thresholds of the gate, which prevents chattering or fluttering.
- Floor: The minimum level of the gated signal.

### Sidechain
 
The sidechain section allows you to use an external or internal signal as a trigger for the compressor or gate. You can adjust the following parameters:

- Source: The source of the sidechain signal, which can be external (from another track or bus) or internal (from the input signal).
- Filter: The type and frequency range of the filter applied to the sidechain signal, which can be low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-reject.
- Listen: A button that allows you to monitor the sidechain signal instead of the output signal.

### Output
  
The output section allows you to control the overall level and metering of the output signal. You can adjust the following parameters:

- Meter: The type of metering displayed on
the output meter, which can be input,
output, gain reduction, or bypass. 8cf37b1e13
