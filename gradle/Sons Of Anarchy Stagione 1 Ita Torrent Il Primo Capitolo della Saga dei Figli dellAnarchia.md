Sons of Anarchy is a TV series that ran from 2008 to 2014 on FX, created by Kurt Sutter. It tells the story of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in Charming, a fictional town in California's Central Valley. The show focuses on the protagonist Jackson "Jax" Teller (Charlie Hunnam), who is initially the vice president of the club, but later becomes its president. He struggles to balance his loyalty to the club, his family, and his own conscience.
 
The first season of Sons of Anarchy introduces the main characters and the conflicts that will drive the plot throughout the series. Jax discovers a manuscript written by his late father, John Teller, who founded the club with his friend Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman). The manuscript reveals John's vision for the club and his doubts about its violent and criminal activities. Jax begins to question Clay's leadership and his relationship with his mother, Gemma (Katey Sagal), who is married to Clay. Meanwhile, the club faces threats from rival gangs, corrupt law enforcement, and internal betrayal.
