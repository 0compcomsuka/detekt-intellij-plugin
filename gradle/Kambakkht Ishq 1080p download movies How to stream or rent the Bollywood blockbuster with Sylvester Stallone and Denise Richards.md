Here are some of the opinions expressed by different reviewers:

> The Hollywood Reporter: \"The film nominally is a love story â 'Kambakkht Ishq' means, loosely, 'damn love' â between Viraj Shergill (Akshay Kumar) and Simrita Rai (Kareena Kapoor), a top Hollywood stuntman and a surgeon, respectively. They hate love and each other, which according the law of movie plots can lead only to one thing. Most of the film's jokes range from Viagra to flatulence to cream pies... It's all so wild and nutty, one wishes the filmmakers or stars would wink to let us know they're in on the joke. Sadly, that wink never comes.\"

> Times of India: \"Kambakkht Ishq hits an all-new low in several departments. First, it could easily win the award for the silliest story-line for sure... And here we come to the second abysmal point. Never has a Hindi film script ever been so derogatory towards women. Not only does Akshay incessantly address Kareena as 'bitch', he also treats all the other women around him as objects to be abused and literally flung around in bouts of fury.\"

> Movieguide: \"The Bollywood movie from India, KAMBAKKHT ISHQ, which literally means 'Damn Love' in English, is a very fun comedy with romance, action, stunning dance numbers, and great performances. It has very strong Hindu content, however... The movie also has some foul language and sexual innuendo that warrant extreme caution.\"

> Masala: \"The film borders on the silly but the packaging has worked... The film is a visual treat with some stunning locales in Italy and Hollywood. The music by Anu Malik is peppy and foot-tapping. The choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant is brilliant especially in 'Om Mangalam'... Akshay Kumar is in his element as he plays to his strengths - comedy and action. Kareena Kapoor looks gorgeous and acts well too.\"

Kambakkht Ishq is a film that you may either love or hate, depending on your taste and expectations. It is a typical Bollywood masala entertainer that does not aim to be realistic or meaningful. It is a film that you can watch if you are looking for some mindless fun and glamour.
