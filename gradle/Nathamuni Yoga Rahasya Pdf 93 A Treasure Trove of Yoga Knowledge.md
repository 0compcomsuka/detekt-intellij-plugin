# Nathamuni's Yoga Rahasya: A Classic Text on Yoga by a Vaisnavite Saint
 
Nathamuni was a ninth century yogi and Vaisnavite saint who revolutionized many customs prevailing at his time. He is considered to be the first teacher of the Sri Vaisnava tradition, which worships Lord Vishnu as the supreme deity. He also composed many hymns in praise of Vishnu and his incarnations.
 
One of his most important contributions was a text on yoga called the Yoga Rahasya, which means "the secret of yoga". This text was lost for many centuries until it was rediscovered by his descendant, Sri T. Krishnamacharya, a renowned yoga master of the 20th century. Krishnamacharya received the text orally from his father, who had learned it from his ancestors.
